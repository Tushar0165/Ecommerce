# Ecommerce

Ecommerce website :- 

This consists all the features a typical ecommerce website requires. For e.g. Pagination, routing, templates, invoice pdf generation, user login, user signup, user can add thier own products, can edit and delete them. It supports image upload for product image.

I learned to create this project from a udemy node.js course. It is based on MVC approach I have used MongoDB Atlas for cloud database with node.js

Users can add and remove products from cart. Users can place order and payment is handled by stripe User can manage thier orders and can generate invoices of thier orders. Users can add thier own products and can also edit and delete them.
